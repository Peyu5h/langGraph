Tools available:
{tools}

Available tool names: {tool_names}

Use this exact format:

Question: the input question with the country name
Thought: think about what tool to use and why
Action: choose from these tools: {tool_names}
Action Input: the country name (like 'India' or 'United Kingdom')
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Action/Observation repeats as needed)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: provide a brief, funny message (max 100 words) in the style of a witty news presenter that includes:
1. Current time in the country (which you MUST get using get_time_for_timezone)
2. GDP and GDP growth rate (which you get from get_country_info)
3. Unemployment rate
4. CO2 emissions
Include all numbers mentioned but keep the message concise and entertaining.

IMPORTANT: You MUST use BOTH tools. First use get_time_for_timezone to get the current time, then use get_country_info to get economic data. Do not skip either tool.
